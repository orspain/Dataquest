    "In our previous exercise, we used Series.sample() to sample. This method performs simple random sampling by generating an array of random numbers, and then using those numbers to select values from a Series at the indices corresponding to those random numbers. The method can be also extended for DataFrame objects, where random rows or columns can be sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the random_state parameter, like we did in the previous exercise with Series.sample(30, random_state = 1), we make the generation of random numbers predictable. This is because Series.sample() uses a pseudorandom number generator under the hood. A pseudorandom number generator uses an initial value to generate a sequence of numbers that has properties similar to those of a sequence that is truly random. With random_state we specify that initial value used by the pseudorandom number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to generate a sequence of five numbers using a pseudorandom generator, and begin from an initial value of 1, we'll get the same five numbers no matter how many times we run the code. If we ran wnba['Games Played'].sample(5, random_state = 1) we'd get the same sample every time we run the code.\n",

    " - Sample 10 values from the PTS column.\n",
    " - Compute the mean of this sample made of 10 values from the PTS column, and append the result to a list.\n",
    " - To make your results reproducible, vary the random_state parameter of the sample() method with values between 0 and 99. For the first iteration of the for loop, random_state should equal 0, for the second iteration should equal 1, for the third should equal 2, and so on.\n",
    " - Display the discrepancy between the parameter of interest (the mean of the PTS column) and the statistics obtained in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using plt.scatter(), display all the 100 sample means using a scatter plot. For the x-axis, use integers from 1 to 100 to designate the sample number. Use the y-axis for the sample means.\n",

    "The poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played. The minutes played are a much better indicator of how much a player scored in a season than the number of games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need a more granular stratification (need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Maximize the variability between strata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or to change the stratification criterion. In the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that weren't too different from each other with respect to the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The stratification criterion should be strongly correlated with the property you're trying to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be strongly correlated with the number of total points (property we want to measure). We've covered briefly the concept of correlation in the pandas courses, and we'll cover it again later in these statistics courses, so don't worry if the concept of correlation doesn't make much sense to you now."
