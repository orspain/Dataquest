    "## The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### From our background research we can state the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll want to focus on high schools.\n",
    " - New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    " - New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    " - Our data sets include several different types of schools. We'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    " - Each school in New York City has a unique code called a DBN, or district borough number.\n",
    " - Aggregating data by district will allow us to use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following files have been stored in the `schools` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - `ap_2010.csv` - Data on AP test results\n",
    " - `class_size.csv` - Data on class size\n",
    " - `demographics.csv` - Data on demographics\n",
    " - `graduation.csv` - Data on graduation outcomes\n",
    " - `hs_directory.csv` - A directory of high schools\n",
    " - `sat_results.csv` - Data on SAT scores\n",
    " \n",
    " - `survey_all.txt` - Data on surveys from all schools\n",
    " - `survey_d75.txt` - Data on surveys from New York City district 75\n",
    " \n",
    "We'll start by importing necessary modules and the CSV files. We'll read each of these CSV files into a pandas dataframe, and then store all of the dataframes in a dictionary. This will give us a convenient way to store them, and a quick way to reference them later on."

    " - There's only a single row for each high school, so each `DBN` is unique in the SAT data.\n",

That means we’ll have to do some preprocessing to ensure that each `DBN` is unique within each data set. If we don't do this, we'll run into problems when we combine the data sets, because we might be merging two rows in one data set with one row in another data set."

    "## Merging Data -  Left, Right, Inner, and Outer Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we merge our data, we'll need to decide on the merge strategy we want to use. We'll be using the `pandas.DataFrame.merge()` function, which supports four types of joins -- `left`, `right`, `inner`, and `outer`. Each of these join types dictates how pandas combines the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the `DBN` column to identify matching rows across data sets. In other words, the values in that column will help us know which row from the first data set to combine with which row in the second data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be `DBN` values that exist in one data set but not in another. This is partly because the data is from different years. Each data set also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the `DBN` values in `sat_results` in all of the other data sets, and other data sets may have `DBN` values that don't exist in `sat_results`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll merge two data sets at a time. For example, we'll merge `sat_results` and `hs_directory`, then merge the result with `ap_2010`, then merge the result of that with `class_size`. We'll continue combining data sets in this way until we've merged all of them. Afterwards, we'll have roughly the same number of rows, but each row will have columns from all of the data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merge strategy we pick will affect the number of rows we end up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project is concerned with determing demographic factors that correlate with SAT score, we'll want to preserve as many rows as possible from `sat_results` while minimizing null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we may need to use different merge strategies with different data sets. Some of the data sets have a lot of missing `DBN` values. This makes a left join more appropriate, because we don't want to lose too many rows when we merge. If we did an inner join, we would lose the data for many high schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data sets have `DBN` values that are almost identical to those in `sat_results`. Those data sets also have information we need to keep. Most of our analysis would be impossible if a significant number of rows was missing from demographics, for example. Therefore, we'll do an inner join to avoid missing data in these columns."

    "\n",
    "We noticed that the inner joins resulted in 116 fewer rows in `sat_results`. This is because pandas couldn't find the `DBN` values that existed in `sat_results` in the other data sets. While this is worth investigating, we're currently looking for high-level correlations, so we don't need to dive into which `DBN`s are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have noticed that we now have many columns with `NaN` values. This is because we chose to do left joins, where some columns may not have had data. The data set also had some missing values to begin with. If we hadn't performed a left join, all of the rows with missing data would have been lost in the merge process, which wouldn't have left us with many high schools in our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to handle missing data, and we'll cover them in more detail later on. For now, we'll just fill in the missing values with the overall `mean` for the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can fill in missing data in pandas using the `pandas.DataFrame.fillna()` method. This method will replace any missing values in a dataframe with the values we specify. We can compute the mean of every column using the `pandas.DataFrame.mean()` method. If we pass the results of the `df.mean()` method into the `df.fillna()` method, pandas will fill in the missing values in each column with the mean of that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "`means = df.mean()`\n",
    "`df = df.fillna(means)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if a column consists entirely of `NaN` values, pandas won't be able to fill in the missing values when we use the `df.fillna()` method along with the `df.mean()` method, because there won't be a mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should fill any `NaN` values that remain after the initial replacement with the value `0`. We can do this by passing `0` into the `df.fillna()` method.\n"

    "\n",
    "Unsurprisingly, `SAT Critical Reading Avg. Score`, `SAT Math Avg. Score`, `SAT Writing Avg. Score`, and `sat_score` are strongly correlated with `sat_score`. \n",
    "\n",
    " - `total_enrollment` has a strong positive correlation with `sat_score`. \n",
    "   - This is surprising because we'd expect smaller schools where students receive more attention to have higher scores. However, it looks like the opposite is true -- larger schools tend to do better on the SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other columns that are proxies for enrollment correlate similarly. \n",
    "  - These include `total_students`, `N_s`, `N_p`, `N_t`, `AP Test Takers`, `Total Exams Taken`, and `NUMBER OF SECTIONS`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both the percentage of females (`female_per`) and number of females (`female_num`) at a school correlate positively with SAT score, whereas the percentage of males (`male_per`) and the number of males (`male_num`) correlate negatively. \n",
    "  - This could indicate that women do better on the SAT than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Teacher and student ratings of school safety (`saf_t_11`, and `saf_s_11`) correlate with `sat_score`.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - Student ratings of school academic standards (`aca_s_11`) correlate with `sat_score`, but this does not hold for ratings from teachers and parents (`aca_p_11` and `aca_t_11`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - There is significant racial inequality in SAT scores (`white_per`, `asian_per`, `black_per`, `hispanic_per`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - The percentage of English language learners at the school (`ell_percent`, `frl_percent`) has a strong negative correlation with SAT scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Because enrollment seems to have such a strong correlation, let's make a scatterplot of `total_enrollment` vs `sat_score`. Each point in the scatterplot will represent a high school, so we'll be able to see if there are any interesting patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can plot columns in a dataframe using the `pandas.DataFrame.plot()` accessor on a dataframe. We can also specify a certain plot type. For example, `df.plot.scatter(x=\"A\", y=\"b\")` will create a scatterplot of columns `A` and `B`."

    "Judging from the plot we just created, it doesn't appear that there's an extremely strong correlation between `sat_score` and `total_enrollment`. If there was a very strong correlation, we'd expect all of the points to line up. Instead, there's a large cluster of schools, and then a few others going off in three different directions.\n",

This indicates that it's actually `ell_percent` that correlates strongly with `sat_score`, rather than `total_enrollment`. To explore this relationship further, let's plot out `ell_percent` vs `sat_score` with a scatter plot."

    "It looks like `ell_percent` correlates with `sat_score` more strongly, because the scatterplot is more linear. However, there's still the cluster of schools that have very high `ell_percent` values and low `sat_score` values. This cluster represents the same group of international high schools we investigated earlier.\n",
